# My Webframeworks Practical Assignment Overview

In this project, part of my Webframeworks course, I focus on developing skills essential for creating Enterprise Web Applications. I am collaborating on this project with one other classmate. Through this coursework, I aim to achieve several key competencies:

**1. Enterprise Web Application Architecture:** <br>
I gained an in-depth understanding of the layered architecture of enterprise web applications and applied appropriate front-end and back-end design patterns.


**2. Developing User Interfaces:** <br>
Using Vue.js along with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I designed and developed rich, responsive user interfaces, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

**Back-end REST-API Development:**<br>
I developed a back-end using Spring-Boot, creating RESTful services and integrating the Java Persistence API (JPA) for efficient data handling.

**Persistence Layer and Database Integration:** <br>
I designed and implemented a persistence layer in the backend, connecting it with a relational database using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

**Implementing Web Application Security:** <br>
I addressed security challenges by implementing authentication and authorization controls using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

**Real-time Communication:** <br>
I explored and implemented Web Sockets to enable real-time, cross-session change notifications, facilitating live user collaboration.

### Technologies and Learning Tools:
* Front-end development was primarily done with Vue.js.
* For the back-end, I used Spring-Boot and interfaced with the Java Persistence API (JPA).
* I ensured secure data management by integrating a relational database.
* To enhance security, I incorporated JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* I utilized Web Sockets for instant change notifications among users.
* Course Relevance and Application:
* This project was pivotal in my understanding of building and managing scalable, secure, and interactive web applications. It was a practical application of the theoretical concepts taught in the course, reflecting my comprehensive grasp of creating real-world web solutions.
